Project Overview
You’re building a web-based therapy chat application that connects users with an AI therapist, powered by cutting-edge language models, and delivers detailed mental health insights. The app combines an intuitive chat experience, robust session management, and professional-grade reporting—all wrapped in a soothing, user-friendly design inspired by leading therapy platforms like BetterHelp and Talkspace.

Core Features
1. Interactive Chat Interface
Real-Time Engagement: A dynamic chat window where users exchange messages with an AI therapist in real time, complete with typing indicators and timestamps for a lifelike conversation flow.
AI Flexibility: Powered by Gemini by default, with a modular backend that allows seamless switching to other large language models (LLMs) via a configuration setting—perfect for future-proofing and experimentation.
Personalized Responses: The AI adapts its tone and suggestions based on user input, fostering a supportive and empathetic dialogue.
Scalable Inputs: Designed for text now, with hooks for future enhancements like voice messages or image sharing to deepen therapeutic expression.
2. Advanced Conversation Management System
Multi-Session Hub: Users can initiate and maintain distinct therapy sessions, each preserved as a separate thread with its own history.
Smart Organization: Options to name sessions (e.g., “Stress Relief,” “October Check-In”), search through past chats, and tag conversations for quick retrieval.
Session Lifecycle: Tools to archive completed sessions or delete outdated ones, keeping the interface clutter-free and meaningful.
Progress Snapshots: AI-generated mini-summaries for each session, spotlighting key moments or recurring themes to help users track their journey.
3. Automated Mental Health Report Generation
Comprehensive Insights: Automatically compiles reports with:
Mental Health Summary: A concise overview of the user’s emotional state, distilled from conversation patterns and recurring topics.
Symptom Timeline: Visual tracking of reported symptoms (e.g., anxiety, low mood) with timestamps, presented as interactive graphs or chronological markers.
Conversation Export: Full session transcripts exportable in professional formats (PDF, CSV) for sharing with healthcare providers.
Intelligent Analysis: Leverages natural language processing to identify and categorize symptoms, moods, and therapeutic progress.
Secure Handling: Reports are encrypted and accessible only to authorized users, ensuring privacy and compliance with healthcare standards.
